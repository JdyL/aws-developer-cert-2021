# AWS Developer Cert 2021 Quiz Helper

The purpose of this project is to aid in studying for the AWS Developer Associate certificate by using questions and answers from ExamTopics. ExamTopics provides a range of questions to practice with for the exam however, some of these questions are incorrect when showing answer and the correct answer can be found in the Discussion. It causes misunderstanding and confusion so I quickly made this app. 

The questions are updated as of 27/11/2021
